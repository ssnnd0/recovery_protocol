## About

Recovery Protocol is a modern mobile application built with Flutter, designed to support athletes—whether competitive or fitness-focused—with AI-infused, personalized recovery plans. The app aims to bring scientific recovery guidance right into your pocket. 

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure your development environment includes:

* Flutter SDK (v ^3.29.2)
* Dart SDK
* Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
* Android SDK (for Android builds)
* Xcode (for iOS builds) 

---

## Installation & Running

```bash
# Install project dependencies
flutter pub get

# Launch the app (connect a device or emulator)
flutter run
```

That’s it—simple and straightforward!

## Routing

To manage navigation, update `lib/routes/app_routes.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:your_package/presentation/home_screen/home_screen.dart';

class AppRoutes {
  static const String initial = '/';
  static const String home = '/home';
  static Map<String, WidgetBuilder> routes = {
    initial: (context) => const SplashScreen(),
    home: (context) => const HomeScreen(),
    // Add other routes here
  };
}
```



---

## Theming & Responsiveness

* **Theming**: The app provides both light and dark themes, including color schemes, typography, button styles, input decorations, and card/dialog styling. Usage is done via `Theme.of(context)` and color schemes from the theme.
* **Responsive Design**: Leveraging the `Sizer` package, UI components scale dynamically. Example usage:

  ```dart
  Container(
    width: 50.w, // 50% of screen width
    height: 20.h, // 20% of screen height
    child: Text('Responsive Container'),
  )
  ```



---

## Deployment

### Android

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```



---

## Future Roadmap

* **AI Recovery Algorithm** – Integrate the core AI engine to generate recovery routines based on user data.
* **Apple HealthKit Sync** – Import health metrics such as sleep, workouts, and activity levels.
* **Exercise Library & Guided Routines** – Display video demonstrations, timed reps, and interactive controls.
* **Progress Analytics Dashboard** – Visualize trends in soreness, fatigue, and routine consistency.
* **Monetization** – Introduce a freemium model with a premium tier offering advanced personalization.
